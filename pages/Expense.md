- ## Expenses visibility
	- The expenses visibility is defined by data access profiles.
	- There are two data access profile setup options for the users:
		- **everything - Everything**
			- Every expense visible in the system
		- **relevant_to_me - Relevant to me**
			- Needs a script to update 'direct' to 'relevant_to_me' where we currently have it. (data migration)
			- Add help text to data access profile where we explain what does it means.
			- Show the help text everywhere in the system (List & Detail pages across the system)
			- Only those expenses are visible for the user where:
				- she/he is the expense's owner
				- her/his subordinates' expenses
				- **she/he created the expense**
- ## Expense creation
- Every user under MV2 able to create on behalf expenses to other colleagues (approved expense cannot be modified!!!)
- ## Notification
	- When "Approval requested" notification is sent to:
		- the expense owner's superior
		- **expense owner (if not he created the expense)**
