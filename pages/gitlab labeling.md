- ## Labeling
- Background / methodology
	- As part of agile workflow, we use Gitlab as a PM tool.
	  Since there are plenty of limitation when it comes to monitoring and visualizing, we have introduced a labeling solution that gives a high level view on stories.
	  We work in approx. one-month-long sprints where we set a release target date which call a milestone.
- Naming and list of labels
	- `issues`

			- **A_CURRENT_ITERATION** : When project is likely to be released in the upcoming milestone
			- **A_BACKLOG** : When project is likely to be released after the next milestone
