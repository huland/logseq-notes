- ## Labeling
- Background / methodology
	- As part of agile workflow, we use Gitlab as a PM tool.
	  Since there are plenty of limitation when it comes to monitoring and visualizing, we have introduced a labeling solution that gives a high level view on stories.
	  We work in approx. one-month-long sprints where we set a release target date which call a milestone.
- Naming and list of labels
	- `issues`
		- **Numbers**: Complexity ( not equal to time but):
			- **1-2-3** <= 1day
			- 1day <= **5-8** <= 1week
			- 1week <= **13-21**
		- **Product backlog**
			- **A_CURRENT_ITERATION** : When project is likely to be released in the upcoming milestone
			- **A_BACKLOG** : When project is likely to be released after the next milestone
			- **A_EPIC** : When projects needs to be split into smaller tasks
		- **ASN Assignee**
			- ASN_ANDRAS: the developer / executer
		- **CR Code reviewer**
			- Each story needs at least one CR label: the primary reviewer if needed, a secondary/senior reviewer
		- **M Business type**: Optional label to categorize stories
			- **M_BUSINESS_CRITICAL**: Bugfixing, obligatory or legal requests
			- **M_BUSINESS_DEVELOPMENT**: Stories that has direct or indirect impact on revenue generation / cost reduction
			- **M_PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT**: Business as usual requirements, typically coming from BO, Finance, Sales, improving procedures or the application itself
			- **M_TECHNICAL**: Typically coming from Dev or Ops, technical improvements to make the code base better
		- **OPS**: Ops interactions needed
		- **P Priority**
			- **P_1_Expected:** Must have
			- **P_2_Performance:** Impacts satisfaction
			- **P_3_Exciter:** Interesting
			- **P_4_Neutral:** No direct impact but might be essential
			- **P_5_Unknown:** Controversial
		- **R Requestor team**: The departments of the organization
		- **S Sprint status**
			- **S_TODO**: Can start work on it
			- **S_INPROGRESS**: In development
			- **S_TOREVIEW**: When the story is handed to a reviewer, during the ping-pong process, it can remain in this state
			- **S_APPROVED**: When the primary reviewer approves the development
			- **S_DONE**: When the issue is closed (doesn't necessarily means the release is over)
			- **S_BLOCKED**: Found a dependency that needs to be solved beforehand
		- **T Type of story**
			- **T_FEATURE**: Improving the system, not exclusively functionality
			- **T_BUG**: An error
			- **T_CHORE**: Technical development needed, often doesn't have direct, visible impact for users
			- **T_PUFFER**: Only a filler, cannot decide
		- **V Business value**
			- V_$ < V_$$ < V_$$$
