# Tiago Forte - Building a second brain
## Question of interest
### Ask yourself:

What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?
	- this could include grand, sweeping questions like:
		- How can we make society fairer and more equitable?
	- practical ones like:
		- How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?
- it might include questions about relationships, such as:
	- How can I have closer relationships with the people I love?
- productivity, like:
	- How can I spend more of my time doing high-value work?
### Reason of a questions

The goal isn’t to definitively answer the question once and for all, but to use the question as a North Star for my learning.
### How to create a question
- Take a moment now to write down some of your own favorite problems.
- Here are my recommendations to guide you:
	- Ask people close to you what you were obsessed with as a child
	    (often you’ll continue to be fascinated with the same things as an adult).
	- Don’t worry about coming up with exactly twelve
	    (the exact number doesn’t matter, but try to come up with at least a few).
	  -Don’t worry about getting the list perfect
	    (this is just a first pass, and it will always be evolving).
	- Phrase them as open-ended questions that could have multiple answers (in contrast to “yes/no” questions with only one answer)
- ## P.A.R.A system
  
  With the PARA system, every piece of information you want to save can be placed into one of just four categories:
- 1. Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now.
  2. Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
  3. Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
  4. Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories.
### Projects: What I’m Working on Right Now

Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work.
- they have a beginning and an end
	- they take place during a specific period of time and then they finish
- they have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete,
	- such as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.
#### Example projects
- Projects at work:
	- Complete web-page design, Create slide deck for conference, Develop project schedule, Plan recruitment drive
- Personal projects:
	- Finish Spanish language course, Plan vacation, Buy new living room furniture, Find local volunteer opportunity
- Side projects:
	- Publish blog post, Launch crowdfunding campaign, Research best podcast microphone, Complete online course
### Areas: What I’m Committed to Over Time
#### Example areas
- In our work lives, we have various ongoing areas we’re responsible for, such as
	- product development
	- quality control
	- human resources
		- these are the job responsibilities that we were hired to take on
	- sometimes there are others that we officially or unofficially have taken ownership of over time
- personal life could include:
	- activities or places you are responsible for:
		- home/apartment, cooking, travel, car
	- people you are responsible for or accountable to:
		- friends, kids, spouse, pets
	- standards of performance you are responsible for:
		- health, personal growth, friendships, finances
	- in your job or business:
		- departments or functions you are responsible for:
			- account management, marketing, operations, product development
		- people or teams you are responsible for or accountable to:
			- direct reports, manager, board of directors, suppliers
		- standards of performance you are responsible for:
			- professional development, sales and marketing, relationships and networking, recruiting and hiring
### Resources: Things I Want to Reference in the Future

This is basically a catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area and could include any topic you’re interested in gathering information about.
#### Example resources
- What topics are you interested in?
	- Architecture, Interior design, English literature, Beer brewing
- What subjects are you researching?
	- Habit formation, Notetaking, Project management, Nutrition
- What useful information do you want to be able to reference?
	- Vacation itineraries, Life goals, Stock photos, Product testimonials
- Which hobbies or passions do you have?
	- Coffee, Classic movies, Hiphop music, Japanese anime
### Archives: Things I’ve Completed or Put on Hold

This includes any item from the previous three categories that is no longer active
#### Example archive
- Projects that are:
	- completed
	- canceled
- Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining
	- such as when a relationship ends or after moving out of your apartment)
- Resources that are no longer relevant
	- hobbies you lose interest in or subjects you no longer care about
## Notetaking

Do not save everything, the best curators are picky about what they allow into their collections, and you should be too.
### Using institution as base of notes

I can’t think of anything more important for your creative life - and your life in general - than learning to listen to the voice of intuition inside.

It is the source of your imagination, your confidence, and your spontaneity. You can intentionally train yourself to hear that voice of intuition every day by taking note of what it tells you.
### Metadata

It’s a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note
- such as the original web page address
- the title of the piece
- the author or publisher
- and the date it was published
  
  Capturing passages from ebooks
### Progressive Summarization

I recommend using bullet points to encourage yourself to make this executive summary succinct.
- use your own words
- define any unusual terms you’re using
- think about how your future self
	- who may not remember anything about this source, might interpret what you’re writing
#### Highlighting can sometimes feel risky.

You may wonder,
- am I making the right decision about which points are most important, or what this source means?
- the multiple layers of Progressive Summarization are like a safety net;
	- if you go in the wrong direction, or make a mistake, you can always just go back to the original version and try again as nothing gets forgotten or deleted.
#### Highlighting hints
- a helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10–20 percent of the previous layer
	- if you save a series of excerpts from a book amounting to five hundred words,
	- the bolded second layer should include no more than one hundred words
	- highlighted third layer no more than twenty
	  
	  This isn’t an exact science, but if you find yourself highlighting everything, this rule should give you pause
#### Continouos note handling

The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future self by
- adding a highlight
- a heading, some bullets
- commentary
- this is the “campsite rule” applied to information:
	- leave it better than you found it
## Intermediate Packets: The Power of Thinking Small

Small pieces of work-in-process it contains I call Intermediate Packets.
### Intermediate Packets types

There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your work:

1. Distilled notes: Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get the gist of what they contain (using the Progressive Summarization).
1. Outtakes: The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones
1. Work-in-process:
	- documents
	- graphics
	- agendas
	- plans you produced during past projects
	  1. Final deliverables: Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new.
	  1. Documents created by others:
	- Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work.
### Making the shift

Making the shift to working in terms of Intermediate Packets unlocks several very powerful benefits
- you’ll become interruption-proof
	- you are focusing only on one small packet at a time, instead of trying to load up the entire project into your mind at once
	- you become less vulnerable to interruptions, because you’re not trying to manage all the work-in-process in your head
- you’ll be able to make progress in any span of time.
	- instead of waiting until you have multiple uninterrupted hours - which, let’s face it, is rare and getting rarer - you can look at how many minutes you have free and choose to work on an IP that you can get done within that time, even if it’s tiny.
## CODE described

The first two steps of CODE Capture and Organize, make up divergence.
- They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing them in a secure place.
- This is where you research, explore, and add ideas.
  
  The final two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence.
- They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks we’ve assembled.
### Forward progress

When in fact they are divergent acts that postpone the moment of completion
- Should you do more research, or start organizing the research you’ve already done?
- Should you widen your horizons, or narrow your focus?
- Should you start something new, or finish something you’ve already started?
- When you distinguish between the two modes of divergence and convergence, you can decide each time you begin to work which mode you want to be in.
  
  The two stages of this process, convergence is where most people struggle:
- the more imaginative and curious you are
- the more diverse your interests
- the higher your standards and commitment to perfection
  
  the more difficult you will likely find it to switch from divergence mode into convergence mode.
  
  
  It’s painful to cut off options and choose one path over another. There is a kind of creative grief in watching an idea that you know is full of potential get axed from a script or a story. This is what makes creative work challenging.
  
  When you sit down to finish something — whether it’s an explanatory email, a new product design, a research report, or a fundraising strategy — it can be so tempting to do more research.
  
  It’s so easy to open up dozens of browser tabs, order more books, or go off in completely new directions.
  
  Those actions are tempting because they feel like productivity. They feel like forward progress, when in fact they are divergent acts that postpone the moment of completion.
### Completing creative projects

There are three powerful strategies for completing creative projects I recommend to help you through the pitfalls of convergence

1. The Archipelago of Ideas: Give Yourself Stepping-Stones
	- The goal of an archipelago is that instead of sitting down to a blank page or screen and stressing out about where to begin
		- you start with a series of small stepping-stones to guide your efforts
		  
		  1. The Hemingway Bridge: Use Yesterday’s Momentum Today
		  
		  1. Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something Small and Concrete
	- When the full complexity of a project starts to reveal itself, most people choose to delay it. This is true of projects at work, and even more true of side projects we take on in our spare time.
		- We tell ourselves we just need more time, but the delay ends up creating more problems than it solves.
		- We start to lose motivation as the time horizon stretches out longer and longer. Things get lost or go out of date.
		- Postponing our goals and desires to “later” often ends up depriving us of the very experiences we need to grow.
		  
		  The problem isn’t a lack of time. It is that we forget that we have control over the scope of the project.
		  
		  We can “dial it down” to a more manageable size, and we must if we ever want to see it finished.
		  
		  Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that not all the parts of a given project are equally important.
		  
		  Your Second Brain is a crucial part of this strategy, because you need a place to save the parts that get postponed or removed
## Project kickoff/completion checklists
### Project Kickoff checklist

Every goal, collaboration, or assignment we take on can be defined as a project, which gives it shape, focus, and a sense of direction

This is where the Project Kickoff Checklist comes in.

Checklist:

1. Capture my current thinking on the project.
1. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes.
1. Search for related terms across all folders.
1. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder.
1. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project
#### Capture my current thinking on the project

Here are some questions I use to prompt this initial brainstorm:
- What do I already know about this project?
- What don’t I know that I need to find out?
- What is my goal or intention?
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights?
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?
  
  Answer premortem. I questions:
- What do you want to learn?
- What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer?
- What is most likely to fail?
  
  Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters.
  Define success criteria:
- What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful?
- What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for?
- Have an official kickoff:
	- Schedule check-in calls
	- make a budget and timeline
	- write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is informed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them
	  I find that doing an official kickoff is useful even if it’s a solo project!
### Project Completion checklist
- Document any thinking that could add value in the future.
- This is where the Project Completion Checklist is essential.
- It’s a series of steps you can take to decide if there are any reusable knowledge assets worth keeping, before archiving the rest.
- The only way that the Kickoff Checklist we just looked at will be feasible is if you’ve previously taken the time to save and preserve material from past projects.
  
  Checklist:
  
  1. Mark project as complete in task manager or project management app
	- keeping an inventory of your victories and successes is a wonderful use for your Second Brain
	  1. Cross out the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section
	- cross out the goal and move it to a different section
	- need some motivation, I can look through this list and be reminded of all the meaningful goals I’ve achieved in the past
	  1. Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders.
	- look through the folder for the completed project to identify any Intermediate Packets
	- any IPs I decide could be relevant to another project, I move to that project’s folder, the same goes for notes relevant to areas or resources
	  1. Move project to archives across all platforms.
	- move the project folder to the archives in my notes app, as well as any other platforms I used during the project
	- If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving
		- add a new note to the project folder titled “Current status,” and jot down a few comments so I can pick it back up in the future.
		  1. If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving
		  
		  
		  If all the tasks I find there are done, I can mark it as complete and move on to the following steps.
#### Extra items to do at completion check

Here are some other items you can include on your Project Completion Checklist. I encourage you to personalize it for your own needs:
- Answer postmortem questions:
	- What did you learn?
	- What did you do well?
	- What could you have done better?
	- What can you improve for next time?
- Communicate with stakeholders:
	- Notify your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc.,
	- that the project is complete and what the outcomes were.
- Evaluate success criteria:
	- Were the objectives of the project achieved?
	- Why or why not?
	- What was the return on investment?
- Officially close out the project and celebrate:
	- Send any last emails, invoices, receipts, feedback forms, or documents, and celebrate your accomplishments with your team or collaborators so you receive the feeling of fulfillment for all the effort you put in
## Reviews
### A Weekly Review Template

This weekly sorting process serves as a light reminder of the knowledge I’ve accumulated over the past week

1. Clear my email inbox
	- Clearing my email inbox for any emails lingering from the past week
	- I don’t usually have time to do this during the week in the rush of my other priorities, but I’ve found that
		- if I let messages accumulate from one week to the next, it makes it hard to figure out what’s new and requires action and what’s left over from the past
		- Any action items I find get saved in my task manager, and any notes I capture get saved in my notes app
		  1. Check my calendar
	- I check my calendar.
	- This is the landscape of my week, showing me the meetings and appointments I need to make room for.
	- I typically look at the:
		- last couple of weeks
		    in case there’s anything I need to follow up on
		- upcoming couple of weeks
		    in case there’s anything I need to prepare for
	- Once again, anything I need to act on gets saved in my task manager, and any notes get captured in my notes app.
	  1. Clear my computer desktop
	- I clear the files that have accumulated on my computer desktop
	- I’ve found that if I let them accumulate week after week, eventually my digital environment gets so cluttered that I can’t think straight.
	- Any files potentially relevant to my projects, areas, or resources get moved to the appropriate PARA folders in my computer’s file system
	  1. Clear my notes inbox
	- The inbox in my notes app is chock-full of interesting tidbits from the previous three steps
	- batch process them all at once, making quick, intuitive decisions about which of the PARA folders each note might be relevant to, and creating new folders as needed
	  1. Choose my tasks for the week
### Monthly Review Template: Reflect for Clarity and Control

1. Review and update my goals
	- take some time to cross off any completed goals, add any new ones that have emerged, or change the scope of goals that no longer make sense
	  1. Review and update my project list
	- includes archiving any completed or canceled projects, adding any new ones, or updating active projects to reflect how they’ve changed
	- important that the project list remains a current, timely, and accurate reflection of your real-life goals and priorities
	  1. Review my areas of responsibility
	  1. Review someday/maybe tasks
	- go through my “someday/maybe” tasks just in case any of them have become actionable
	- someday, but not in the near future, things like “Learn Mandarin” and “Plant an orchard.”
	- these kinds of future dreams are important to keep track of, but you don’t want them cluttering your priorities today
	  1. Reprioritize tasks
	- completed all the previous steps and have a holistic picture of my goals and projec
## Habits
### The Noticing Habits: Using Your Second Brain to Engineer Luck

Taking advantage of small opportunities you notice to capture something you might otherwise skip
- Noticing that an idea you have in mind could potentially be valuable and capturing it instead of thinking, “Oh, it’s nothing.”
- Noticing when an idea you’re reading about resonates with you and taking those extra few seconds to highlight it.
- Noticing that a note could use a better title—and changing it so it’s easier for your future self to find it.
- Noticing you could move or link a note to another project or area where it will be more useful.
- Noticing opportunities to combine two or more Intermediate Packets into a new, larger work so you don’t have to start it from scratch.
- Noticing a chance to merge similar content from different notes into the same note so it’s not spread around too many places.
- Noticing when an IP that you already have could help someone else solve a problem, and sharing it with them, even if it’s not perfect.
### Three habits to do.

Three kinds of habits I’ve introduced you to
1. Project Kickoff and Completion Checklists
1. Weekly and Monthly Reviews
1. Noticing Habits
## Maintenance

The maintenance of your Second Brain is very forgiving.
- knowledge is now our most important asset and the ability to deploy our attention
- viewing the world through the lens of scarcity to seeing it through the lens of abundance
## CODE summary

CODE: Keep what resonates (Capture) Save for actionability (Organize) Find the essence (Distill) Show your work (Express)
- Are you hoping to remember more?
	- Focus on developing the practice of capturing and organizing your notes according to your projects, commitments, and interests using PARA
- Are you hoping to connect ideas and develop your ability to plan, influence, and grow in your personal and professional life?
	- Experiment with consistently distilling and refining your notes using Progressive Summarization and revisiting them during weekly reviews
- Are you committed to producing more and better output with less frustration and stress?
	- Focus on creating one Intermediate Packet at a time and looking for opportunities to share them in ever more bold ways
### Summary

1. Decide what you want to capture
1. Choose your notes app
1. Choose a capture tool
1. Get set up with PARA
1. Get inspired by identifying your twelve favorite problems
1. Automatically capture your ebook highlights

  What do you most want to capture, learn, explore, or share? Identify two to three kinds of content that you already value to get started with.
	- starting with a read later app
	- make a list of some of your favorite problems, save the list as a note, and revisit it any time you need ideas for what to capture
	  1. Practice Progressive Summarization
	  1. Experiment with just one Intermediate Packet
	  1. Make progress on one deliverable
	  
	  using the Express techniques of:
	- Archipelago of Ideas
	- Hemingway Bridge
	- Dial Down the Scope
	  1. Schedule a Weekly Review
	  
	  Put a weekly recurring meeting with yourself on your calendar to begin establishing the habit of conducting a Weekly Review.
	  1. Assess your notetaking proficiency
	  
	  Evaluate your current notetaking practices and areas for potential improvement using our free assessment tool at Buildingasecondbrain.com/quiz.
	  1. Join the PKM community
	  
	  While building a Second Brain is a project - something you can commit to and achieve within a reasonable period of time - using your Second Brain is a lifelong practice.
	  
	  I recommend you revisit Building a Second Brain at various points over time. I guarantee you’ll notice things you missed the first time.
- The practice begins and ends with notetaking:
	- including capturing
	- organizing
	- distilling
	- expressing information
	- ideas
	- and packets of work
